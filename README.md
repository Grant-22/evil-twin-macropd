# evil-twin (macropad)
i am planning to recreate a macropad ive been using for almost a decade, whist there isnt anything wrong with it,       id like to improve some things:
bluetooth/battery powered (nice! nano)
be powered by zmk (nice! nano)
                                    have the 2u key stabilisied
whilst keeping the same form factor and case look

this board i have previously millmaxed
but in the new version i will most likey just hard solder as i am very happy keeping my ttc blueish whites 
im hoping to keep the keycaps as low as possible so im going to try trim the leftover switch legs and case off flush with the underside of the pcb lay a strip of capton tape and them place the nice! nano directly on the underside of the pcb 
and follow this step with the battery also
